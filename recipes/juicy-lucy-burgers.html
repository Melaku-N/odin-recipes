    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The famous Juicy Lucy burger is a favorite of Minnesotans. It's so good!
      You must use American cheese on this to achieve the juiciness in the
      middle. I like saut√©ed mushrooms and onions on mine.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 &frac12; pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>&frac34; teaspoon garlic salt</li>
      <li>4 slices American cheese (such as Kraft)</li>
      <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and garlic salt together
        in a bowl until well combined. Form into eight thin patties, each
        slightly larger than a cheese slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack all cheese slices and cut into four squares. Place one small
        cheese stack in the center of a beef patty; cover with another beef
        patty and tightly pinch the edges together to seal around the cheese. Be
        sure to seal tightly, or the cheese will burst through when cooked.
        Repeat with the remaining cheese and patties.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in the hot
        skillet until well browned, about 4 minutes; they will puff up due to
        steam from the melting cheese. Flip patties, prick the tops to release
        steam, and cook until browned on the other side and no longer pink in
        the center; about 4 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
        into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve on hamburger buns.</li>
